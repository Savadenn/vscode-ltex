## 4.6.6 — “The Timeout Theorem”

## 3.8.0

- Update to LanguageTool 3.8 (see [LT 3.8 release notes](https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool/blob/aa1bef4c0108e25eea7f71bd557b6cc4d9c53c2b/languagetool-standalone/CHANGES.md#38-2017-06-27))
- Update versioning to reflect LanguageTool versioning
- Remove preview flag since no blocker issues have been reported

## 0.0.4

- Add configuration to make extension opt-in by workspace thanks to [Faustino Aguilar](https://github.com/faustinoaq) ([PR #5](https://github.com/adamvoss/vscode-languagetool/pull/5)) (workaround for [Microsoft/vscode#15611](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15611))
